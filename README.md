# Huffman-Text-Coding
  This C programme eancodes text files using Huffman's method (Tree) that converts all text into a binary code
  you must enter the file name not its path because that name will be used to name the ecoded file
  The output of thsi programme consists of two files : encoded_{fileName}.txt and CodeMap_{fileName}.bin
  This latter contains leaves of the Huffman's tree I sed to encode the text, it can be quite useful to decode the file again
